        <p>
          I am a front-end focused engineer with back-end experience.<br /><br />
          I love working on high-impact UI performance optimizations. My
          favorite type of work though is Architecture, because of how it
          impacts the entire organization. Architecture is what lets
          organizations collaborate and scale as well as optimize local
          performance.<br /><br />
          I value readability and maintainability, because nothing makes me
          happier than making the future engineers enjoy working with my code
          because of its meaningful semantics, ease of change and removal as
          well as testability.<br /><br />
          I like to work on tools, which improve the Developer Experience and
          that is why I invest in Open Source.

          <h4>Senior JavaScript Engineer</h4>

          <p>
            Webflow is a tool for designers and makers that allows them to build
            a fully custom production-ready site that includes the designer,
            CMS, E-Commerce, and more. <br /><br />
            My area is the designer. I was part of the engineering team building
            the UI that customers use to design their site.
            <br /><br />
          </p>
          <h4 id="webflow-achievements">Achievements</h4>
          <ul style="list-style-type: '- '">
            <li>
              I laid the foundation of flow types in the style system. Webflow
              has adopted
              <a href="https://flow.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
                >flow type</a
              >
              retrospectively and my task was to define types for the existing
              style system.
              <figure>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    The type safety of the style system is now one of the best
                    parts of the product. While it still isn't sound, changing
                    types can inform an engineer of many of the call sites
                    necessary to rectify.
                  </p>

            <li>
              <p>
                I refactored and migrated the synchronization logic for CSS in
                the designer. It was inconsistently serialized, deserialized,
                and modified during loading and saving phases. It was
                challenging because hundreds of thousands of sites were using
                differently generated CSS because of the changes introduced to
                the designer. I have managed to migrate the pre- and
                post-processing logic while making sure no site has been
                affected.
              </p>
              <figure>
                <blockquote>
                  <p>
                    Removing "styleText" was legit a big deal. Be proud of that!
                    That has been looked at with closed- eyes by so many
                    engineers over the years. Also, while it had a clear end
                    goal, there wasn't much pre-defined on what to do, and you
                    navigated a poorly lit tunnel to shut it off and learned a
                    lot about our data integrity and a portion of our patching
                    system along the way!

              I built parts of the new Style Engine as part of the Style System
              effort that is powering today local and default styles rendering
              on the canvas and server-side rendered atoms styles.

              I lead the Distributed Architecture Pre-Brief. It's goal was to
              discuss and formalize architectural problems and potential
              solutions in the entire organization. We have collaboratively
              created a high-quality, concise document that laid a foundation
              for the roadmap for the years to come.
            </li>
            <li>
              I have created several pull requests with proof of concepts for
              the CSS-in-JS solution Webflow could use to build it's Designer
              UI.
            </li>
            <li>
              I created 2 RFC documents that encode patterns for optimizing
              performance, which will hopefully help shape the culture around
              performance and align the engineering with those specific ideas.
            </li>
            <li>
              I was part of the Larger Breakpoints effort, which was quite a
              heavy refactoring of our breakpoints logic. We have unified the
              logic handling breakpoints across the entire designer, making it
              consistent, type-safe, easier to understand, and prepared for the

              I built "Isolation Mode" - a feature that would allow users to
              view a single component in isolation. It is a big deal for complex
              sites, where working on one particularly complex element in
              isolation reduces cognitive load and creates clarity.

              I have been part of the componentization effort, fixing various
              bugs with nested symbols (components). In particular, I have been
              fixing a lot of bugs related to isolation mode and nestability.

              I mentored several engineers, including senior engineers, by
              providing meaningful, in-depth explanations in Pull Requests and
              pair programming with them in real-time.

              I made it my responsibility to increase test coverage and types
              coverage in every code area I touched myself or reviewed as a Pull
              Request.

              I actively tackled technical debts by making them transparent
              through documentation and bringing them up in the sprint planning.

            During that time I managed to introduce a new "Feature Driven

            Node.js and MongoDB on the backend, backbone, jQuery and lots of
            other libraries on Front-End. Some of the challenging tasks were:
            scalable candidates calculation, real-time communication, Facebook
            integration, horizontal scale and constantly changing
            requirements.<br /><br />

            I was the first employee of this new social dating platform. Our
            vision was to create a platform where people learn each other in a
